For emergency transfers, the Form HUD-5383 should be used. PHAs may also accept a record of a Federal, State, tribal, territorial or local law enforcement agency, court, or administrative agency. Otherwise, the participant or applicant may also submit the following:<br /><br /><br />	A document signed by an employee, agent, or volunteer of a victim service provider<br />	A document signed by an attorney, or medical professional, or a mental health professional from whom the victim has sought assistance relating to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, or the effects of abuse<br /><br /><br />If one of the two documents above are used, it must be signed by the victim and specify under penalty of perjury that the professional believes in the occurrence of the incident of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking that is the ground for the protections and remedies afforded under VAWA, and that the incident meets the applicable definition of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking under 24 CFR 5.2003.<br /><br />At the discretion of a covered housing provider, a statement or other evidence provided by the applicant or tenant may also be accepted.<br /><br />Cross References: VAWA, Transfer, Emergency Transfer<br /><br />References: 24 CFR 5.2007(b)(1)c; Notice PIH 2017-08 (Sections 8, 12); HUD Multifamily VAWA Resources Page </td><td> 02/10/2022 </td><td> 01/28/2022 </td><td></td><td> https://www.hudexchange.info/faqs/4186/what-are-some-forms-of-documentation-used-to-verify-eligibility/ </td><td> HCV > Moves and Portability > Portability<br />PH > Transfers </td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td> 4185 </td><td> Do Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) transfers take priority over all other transfers? </td><td></td><td> VAWA transfers must be treated as emergency transfers. The Public Housing Agency (PHA)&rsquo;s Emergency Transfer Plan must specifically detail how priority will be given to tenants who qualify for emergency transfer under VAWA, relative to other categories of tenants seeking transfers.<br /><br />HUD&rsquo;s guidance to PHAs specifies that within the Public Housing program, the policies in the Emergency Transfer Plan ensure that emergency transfers under VAWA must receive at least the same priority as other types of emergency transfers.<br /><br />Because owners receiving HAP on behalf of an HCV participant in PBV are not required to establish an Emergency Transfer Plan, the PHA must have emergency transfer policies for PBV participants. PBV participants under VAWA who have lived in the PBV unit for at least one year must be given priority for the next available opportunity for continued tenant-based rental assistance. PHAs must include policies in their Emergency Transfer Plan that address what happens when the victim has been living in a unit for less than one year, or when the victim seeks to move sooner than a tenant-based voucher will be available.<br /><br />Otherwise, PHAs have latitude to define their policy in the Emergency Transfer Plan within the parameters of the guidance provided in Notice PIH 2017-08.<br /><br />Cross References: Public Housing, VAWA, Violence Against Women Act, Emergency Transfer, Policy<br /><br />References: 24 CFR 5.2005(e)(2)(ii)(B)(3); Notice PIH 2017-08 (Section 12) </td><td> 02/10/2022 </td><td> 01/28/2022 </td><td></td><td> https://www.hudexchange.info/faqs/4185/do-violence-against-women-act-transfers-take-priority-over-all-other/ </td><td> HCV > Moves and Portability > Portability<br />PH > Transfers </td><td></td></tr>

Owners of housing under HCV assistance (including project-based housing) that are not considered &ldquo;PHA-Owned&rdquo; are not required to adopt an Emergency Transfer Plan.

<tr><td> 4183 </td><td> Can a Public Housing Agency (PHA) terminate a participant victim protected under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) if the victim has defaulted on an active repayment agreement? </td><td></td><td> Possibly. 24 CFR 982.552(c)(vii) states that Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) have discretion to terminate assistance when a program participant breaches a repayment agreement. However, if the program participant is protected under VAWA, the PHA must not terminate assistance if the participant&rsquo;s breach of the repayment agreement was premised on an act of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. For example, if the program participant was forced to quit their job in order to flee a stalker, and the victim could not fulfill their obligations under the repayment agreement as a result, the PHA must not terminate assistance.<br /><br />Cross References: VAWA, move, repayment<br /><br />References: 24 CFR 966.4(l)(2)(iii); 24 CFR 982.552(c)(vii); 24 CFR 5.2005(d)(2) </td><td> 02/10/2022 </td><td> 01/28/2022 </td><td></td><td> https://www.hudexchange.info/faqs/4183/can-a-public-housing-agency-terminate-a-participant-victim-protected/ </td><td> HCV > Terminations > Terminations<br />PH > Lease Requirements > Tenant Obligations </td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td> 4182 </td><td> Is there a timeframe by which an alleged victim must request protection under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) after an incident of domestic violence? </td><td></td><td> The regulations do not expressly state when an individual must request protection under VAWA. Typically, VAWA considerations are raised after an adverse action is taken against a participant (such as a proposal to terminate assistance).<br /><br />On the other hand, the Public Housing Agency (PHA) may request written documentation of the abuse or incident from the alleged victim. If the alleged victim does not provide documentation after 14 business days of receiving the PHA&rsquo;s request, the PHA has the discretionary authority to deny protections that would otherwise be afforded under VAWA.<br /><br />Cross References: VAWA, family obligations, termination hearing<br /><br />References: 24 CFR 5.2007(a) and (b); Notice PIH 2017-08 (Section 8) </td><td> 02/10/2022 </td><td> 01/28/2022 </td><td></td><td> https://www.hudexchange.info/faqs/4182/is-there-a-timeframe-by-which-an-alleged-victim-must-request-protection/ </td><td> HCV > Terminations > Terminations<br />PH > Lease Requirements > Tenant Obligations </td><td></td></tr>

It is both the tenant and the owner&rsquo;s responsibility to maintain the unit to HQS. Generally, the owner will be considered responsible for addressing infestations, although the tenant is responsible for helping maintain the unit in a sanitary condition, and if failure to do so has contributed to infestation the tenant may be held responsible. However, bedbugs are distinct from other typical examples of vermin in that they are drawn by the presence of people and convenient hiding spaces, and not by food waste or other garbage.<br /><br />Cross References: bedbugs, infestation, vermin, tenant-caused, tenant responsibility, owner responsibility<br /><br />References: 24 CFR 982.401(m); Notice PIH 2012-17 </td><td> 01/26/2022 </td><td> 01/28/2022 </td><td></td><td> https://www.hudexchange.info/faqs/4049/who-is-responsible-for-eradicating-bedbugs-in-units/ </td><td> HCV > Uncategorized > Housing Quality Standards (HQS) </td><td></td></tr>

If so, is there recourse for a family that doesn&rsquo;t want to or can&rsquo;t move without hardship? </td><td></td><td> Yes, although the specifics involve the judgment of the inspector and may require consulting with other local entities. The Housing Inspection Manual lists examples of neighborhood conditions that would &ldquo;seriously and continuously endanger the health or safety of the residents&rdquo; and includes other buildings adjacent to (or near) the property that pose dangers such as a risk of structural collapse. If the inspector has made an assessment that, due to the fire, the neighboring structure is at risk of collapse, the unit can fail Housing Quality Standards (HQS). However, in making this determination, the inspector should consult with local government because there may be need to demolish the dangerous structure. If there is no risk of collapse in the inspector&rsquo;s judgment, there may be no rationale for failing the unit. Additionally, the Manual states that family composition can be taken into consideration; e.g., a family with children may be considered at higher risk as the children could play in or around the unsafe neighboring structure. Alternatively, if the family is only composed of adults, some marginal conditions may not necessarily constitute a failure. If there is no risk of collapse, a burnt-out house may be one of these marginal conditions where the PHA would take into account the family composition and could allow the unit to pass HQS. But that leniency does not apply to a building at risk of structural collapse. Finally, the Manual points out that a good rule of thumb is if market rate families are living in the area, then it is probably passable; this would only apply here if the property is a multi-unit building or there is a building on the other side.<br /><br />If the unit is determined to fail HQS due to neighborhood concerns which cannot reasonably be resolved within an abatement period, the family will be required to move as they cannot continue to occupy a unit which will not pass HQS.<br /><br />Cross References: fire, burnt-out, collapse<br /><br />References: 24 CFR 982.401(l)(2); HUD Housing Inspection Manual (Section 8.10) </td><td> 01/26/2022 </td><td> 01/28/2022 </td><td></td><td> https://www.hudexchange.info/faqs/4047/can-a-pha-fail-a-unit-because-it-is-next-to-a-burned-building/ </td><td> HCV > Uncategorized > Housing Quality Standards (HQS) </td><td></td></tr>

This amount is called the enhanced voucher minimum rent.<br /><br />If a family suffers a decrease in income of at least 15 percent after the eligibility event, their enhanced voucher minimum rent must be changed from the dollar amount they were paying to the percentage of income they were paying for rent at the time of the eligibility event. The exact calculation of the minimum rent will vary depending upon whether the family was unassisted or assisted under a tenant- or project-based contract at the eligibility event.<br /><br />If a family was previously unassisted, the family&rsquo;s revised enhanced voucher minimum rent is the greater of the following:<br /><br /><br />	The percentage of the monthly adjusted income the family paid for gross rent on the effective date of the eligibility event<br />	30 percent of the family&rsquo;s current adjusted monthly income<br /><br /><br />If a family was previously assisted under a project- or tenant-based contract, the family&rsquo;s new enhanced voucher minimum rent is the greater of:<br /><br /><br />	The percentage of adjusted monthly income paid for Total Tenant Payment (TTP) or the voucher family share on the effective date of the eligibility event<br />	30 percent of the family&rsquo;s current adjusted monthly income<br /><br /><br />Once a family&rsquo;s enhanced voucher minimum rent changes, it will continue to be calculated by the percentage of adjusted monthly income until the family&rsquo;s income increases such that the dollar value of the family&rsquo;s enhanced voucher minimum rent established by the percentage is more than the original enhanced voucher minimum rent. When this occurs, the family&rsquo;s enhanced voucher minimum rent will revert to their original enhanced voucher minimum rent.<br /><br />Cross References: enhanced, rent increase<br /><br />References: Notice PIH 2019-12 (Section 1, 2); Notice PIH 2001-41 (Section II.C.3) </td><td> 01/26/2022 </td><td> 01/28/2022 </td><td></td><td> https://www.hudexchange.info/faqs/4023/how-is-an-enhanced-voucher-minimum-rent-determined-at-the-outset/ </td><td> HCV > Special Purpose Vouchers > Enhanced Vouchers (EV) </td><td></td></tr>

Very low-income families (i.e., annual income at or below 50% of the median family income for the area, as determined by HUD) are income-eligible for a TPV. In certain cases, as defined in regulations at 24 CFR 982.201(b), a low-income family (i.e., annual income at or below 80% of the median family income for the area, as determined by HUD) may also be income-eligible for the TPV. For example, a low-income family that is &ldquo;continuously assisted&rdquo; is income-eligible for the TPV. Continuously assisted means that the family is already receiving assistance under any 1937 Housing Act program when they are admitted to the voucher program.<br /><br />The Public Housing Agency (PHA) must establish policies concerning whether and to what extent a brief interruption between assistance under one of these programs and admission to the voucher program will be considered to break continuity of assistance under the 1937 Housing Act.

<tr><td> 3924 </td><td> How should Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) determine rent reasonableness when the lease starts with an owner promotion, such as two-months&rsquo; free rent? </td><td></td><td> The easiest way for a PHA to handle this situation is to have the owner prorate the two free months of rent over a 12-month period, since a specified contract rent amount must be compared to unassisted units when the PHA conducts its rent reasonableness analysis. If the two free months&rsquo; rent are not accounted for during the rent reasonableness analysis, the PHA could possibly not approve the requested rent amount even though the average monthly rent is reasonable. This would lower the monthly contract rent, causing no overpayment.<br /><br />For example, if the two free months of rent amount to $1200, the owner would recalculate the monthly contract rent over a 12-month period by factoring in the $600 in free rent per month for the initial two months. Thus, the monthly contract rent would become $500 rather than $600.<br /><br />Cross References: free month rent, rent promotions, owner promotions<br /><br />References: Notice PIH 2020-19 (Section V.A); 24 CFR 982.308 </td><td> 01/24/2022 </td><td> 01/28/2022 </td><td></td><td> https://www.hudexchange.info/faqs/3924/how-should-public-housing-agencies-phas-determine-rent-reasonableness/ </td><td> HCV > Rent Reasonableness > Program Requirements </td><td></td></tr>

Updated fair market rents (FMRs) are released in September and are effective October 1st.
