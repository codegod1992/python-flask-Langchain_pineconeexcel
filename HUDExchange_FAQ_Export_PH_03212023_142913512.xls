For emergency transfers, the Form HUD-5383 should be used. PHAs may also accept a record of a Federal, State, tribal, territorial or local law enforcement agency, court, or administrative agency. Otherwise, the participant or applicant may also submit the following:<br /><br /><br />	A document signed by an employee, agent, or volunteer of a victim service provider<br />	A document signed by an attorney, or medical professional, or a mental health professional from whom the victim has sought assistance relating to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, or the effects of abuse<br /><br /><br />If one of the two documents above are used, it must be signed by the victim and specify under penalty of perjury that the professional believes in the occurrence of the incident of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking that is the ground for the protections and remedies afforded under VAWA, and that the incident meets the applicable definition of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking under 24 CFR 5.2003.<br /><br />At the discretion of a covered housing provider, a statement or other evidence provided by the applicant or tenant may also be accepted.<br /><br />Cross References: VAWA, Transfer, Emergency Transfer<br /><br />References: 24 CFR 5.2007(b)(1)c; Notice PIH 2017-08 (Sections 8, 12); HUD Multifamily VAWA Resources Page </td><td> 02/10/2022 </td><td> 01/28/2022 </td><td></td><td> https://www.hudexchange.info/faqs/4186/what-are-some-forms-of-documentation-used-to-verify-eligibility/ </td><td> HCV > Moves and Portability > Portability<br />PH > Transfers </td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td> 4185 </td><td> Do Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) transfers take priority over all other transfers? </td><td></td><td> VAWA transfers must be treated as emergency transfers. The Public Housing Agency (PHA)&rsquo;s Emergency Transfer Plan must specifically detail how priority will be given to tenants who qualify for emergency transfer under VAWA, relative to other categories of tenants seeking transfers.<br /><br />HUD&rsquo;s guidance to PHAs specifies that within the Public Housing program, the policies in the Emergency Transfer Plan ensure that emergency transfers under VAWA must receive at least the same priority as other types of emergency transfers.<br /><br />Because owners receiving HAP on behalf of an HCV participant in PBV are not required to establish an Emergency Transfer Plan, the PHA must have emergency transfer policies for PBV participants. PBV participants under VAWA who have lived in the PBV unit for at least one year must be given priority for the next available opportunity for continued tenant-based rental assistance. PHAs must include policies in their Emergency Transfer Plan that address what happens when the victim has been living in a unit for less than one year, or when the victim seeks to move sooner than a tenant-based voucher will be available.<br /><br />Otherwise, PHAs have latitude to define their policy in the Emergency Transfer Plan within the parameters of the guidance provided in Notice PIH 2017-08.<br /><br />Cross References: Public Housing, VAWA, Violence Against Women Act, Emergency Transfer, Policy<br /><br />References: 24 CFR 5.2005(e)(2)(ii)(B)(3); Notice PIH 2017-08 (Section 12) </td><td> 02/10/2022 </td><td> 01/28/2022 </td><td></td><td> https://www.hudexchange.info/faqs/4185/do-violence-against-women-act-transfers-take-priority-over-all-other/ </td><td> HCV > Moves and Portability > Portability<br />PH > Transfers </td><td></td></tr>

Owners of housing under HCV assistance (including project-based housing) that are not considered &ldquo;PHA-Owned&rdquo; are not required to adopt an Emergency Transfer Plan.

<tr><td> 4183 </td><td> Can a Public Housing Agency (PHA) terminate a participant victim protected under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) if the victim has defaulted on an active repayment agreement? </td><td></td><td> Possibly. 24 CFR 982.552(c)(vii) states that Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) have discretion to terminate assistance when a program participant breaches a repayment agreement. However, if the program participant is protected under VAWA, the PHA must not terminate assistance if the participant&rsquo;s breach of the repayment agreement was premised on an act of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. For example, if the program participant was forced to quit their job in order to flee a stalker, and the victim could not fulfill their obligations under the repayment agreement as a result, the PHA must not terminate assistance.<br /><br />Cross References: VAWA, move, repayment<br /><br />References: 24 CFR 966.4(l)(2)(iii); 24 CFR 982.552(c)(vii); 24 CFR 5.2005(d)(2) </td><td> 02/10/2022 </td><td> 01/28/2022 </td><td></td><td> https://www.hudexchange.info/faqs/4183/can-a-public-housing-agency-terminate-a-participant-victim-protected/ </td><td> HCV > Terminations > Terminations<br />PH > Lease Requirements > Tenant Obligations </td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td> 4182 </td><td> Is there a timeframe by which an alleged victim must request protection under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) after an incident of domestic violence? </td><td></td><td> The regulations do not expressly state when an individual must request protection under VAWA. Typically, VAWA considerations are raised after an adverse action is taken against a participant (such as a proposal to terminate assistance).<br /><br />On the other hand, the Public Housing Agency (PHA) may request written documentation of the abuse or incident from the alleged victim. If the alleged victim does not provide documentation after 14 business days of receiving the PHA&rsquo;s request, the PHA has the discretionary authority to deny protections that would otherwise be afforded under VAWA.<br /><br />Cross References: VAWA, family obligations, termination hearing<br /><br />References: 24 CFR 5.2007(a) and (b); Notice PIH 2017-08 (Section 8) </td><td> 02/10/2022 </td><td> 01/28/2022 </td><td></td><td> https://www.hudexchange.info/faqs/4182/is-there-a-timeframe-by-which-an-alleged-victim-must-request-protection/ </td><td> HCV > Terminations > Terminations<br />PH > Lease Requirements > Tenant Obligations </td><td></td></tr>

During this period, residents must be notified of any charges that result from individual checkmetering, but no surcharge will be made based upon these readings. This transition period is intended to provide residents with ample notice of the effects of the checkmetering system will have on their individual utility charges and will also provide a test period during which the PHA can assess the adequacy of its newly established utility allowances.<br /><br />During and after the transition period, the PHA must advise tenants with high utility consumption on methods for reducing their utility usage. This advice and assistance may include counseling, installation of new energy conserving equipment or appliance, and corrective maintenance.<br /><br />Lastly, PHAs must work closely with resident organizations, to the extent practicable, in making plans for conversion of utility service to individual metering.

Do the Public Housing Agencies (PHAs), State, or landlords have any discretion in the process that could bar certain felonies? </td><td></td><td> HUD does not have a blanket policy that prohibits persons with felonies from being an applicant or participant in the Public Housing program or Housing Choice Voucher program. HUD statute and regulations mandate explicit bans on admission or occupancy in both programs in two instances:<br /><br /><br />	Individuals convicted of manufacturing/producing methamphetamine on the premises of federally assisted housing<br />	Sex offenders subject to a lifetime registration requirement under a state sex offender registration program<br /><br /><br />The PHA is also required to establish standards that prohibit the admission of persons who abuse or show a pattern of abuse of alcohol if the PHA has reasonable cause to believe it may threaten the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by the other residents.<br /><br />The PHA must establish standards that prohibit admission of persons who are currently engaging in illegal drug use. Those standards must also prohibit admission when the PHA has reasonable cause to believe a person&rsquo;s pattern of illegal drug use threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents.<br /><br />PHAs must also prohibit admission of an applicant for 3 years from the date of eviction if a household member has been evicted from federally assisted housing for drug-related criminal activity. However, PHAs retain discretion to consider the circumstances and may admit households if it is determined that the evicted household member who engaged in such activity has successfully completed a drug rehabilitation program or that the circumstances which led to eviction no longer exist.<br /><br />Otherwise, PHAs have broad discretion to set their own policies when considering whether to admit applicants with criminal backgrounds, including those with felony convictions. A PHA may not base a determination not to admit an applicant solely on a record of arrest, though the conduct underlying an arrest may be relevant for admissions decisions.<br /><br />Cross References: Public Housing, Felon, Eligibility, Criminal, Background, Banned, Lifetime Ban, Banning, Continued Eligibility, HCV<br /><br />References: 24 CFR 960.203(c)(3); 24 CFR 960.204; 24 CFR 982.552(c); 24 CFR 982.553; Notice PIH 2015-19 </td><td> 01/27/2022 </td><td> 01/28/2022 </td><td></td><td> https://www.hudexchange.info/faqs/4078/are-applicants-with-felonies-banned-from-public-housing-or-any-other/ </td><td> HCV > Eligibility Determination and Denial of Assistance > Background Screening<br />PH > Eligibility Determination and Denial of Assistance > Background Screening </td><td></td></tr>

The annual income of all family members, regardless of their declared eligibility status, is included in the family&rsquo;s annual income. The dollar amount of the prorated Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) cannot be known until a unit is selected. For families with ineligible noncitizens, assistance is prorated by the following methods:<br /><br />For Housing Choice Voucher programs: Divide the number of eligible family members by the total number in the family to find the proration factor and multiply the HAP to be paid by this factor.<br /><br />For Public Housing: After determining the family maximum subsidy (applicable flat rent minus the Total Tenant Payment for the family), divide the maximum subsidy by the number of all persons in the family to determine the member maximum subsidy.

Without verifying eligible immigration status, the PHA runs the risk of violating Section 214. The person applying or being added to the household must provide the appropriate documentation to allow the PHA to verify their status. The SAVE system is the primary method of verification.
